### Makemore

A simple repository that generates names using language modeling. This repo uses simple bigram model to complex sequential achitectures to predict the next character.

More and improved models are in progress. ‚è≥

- Bigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts) (Loss: 2.4807)
- MLP, following [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) (Loss: 2.1681)
- GRU, following [Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259) (Loss: 2.0212)
