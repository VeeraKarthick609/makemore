### Makemore

A simple repository that generates names using language modeling. It employs a basic bigram model to predict the next character based on the previous token, following a straightforward probabilistic approach.

More and improved models are in progress. ‚è≥

- Bigram (one character predicts the next one with a lookup table of counts) (Loss: 2.4807)
- MLP, following [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) (Loss: 2.1681)
